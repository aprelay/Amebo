## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I don't see my ad"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Campaign status is "Active" (check dashboard)
2. ✅ Budget is not depleted (₦5,000 remaining)
3. ✅ You're logged in as a user (not advertiser)
4. ✅ You're on the room list page (not auth page)
5. ✅ Scroll to the bottom of the page

### Issue: "Ad image doesn't load"

**Reason:** Your image URL is a Canva design link, not a direct image URL.

**Fix:** 
1. Open your Canva design: https://www.canva.com/design/DAG8EbMkvKM/GGHOvT5JYgp9hts3SGxrHw
2. Click "Share" → "Download" → "PNG"
3. Upload to an image host (Imgur, Cloudinary, or your website)
4. Get direct image URL (must end with .png or .jpg)
5. Update campaign with new image URL

**Quick fix for testing:**
Use placeholder image: `https://via.placeholder.com/320x100/E91E63/FFFFFF?text=Elegance+By+Koko+50%25+OFF`

### Issue: "Instagram link not working"

**Your link:** https://instagram.com/ovo360  
**Status:** Should work! (Instagram handle exists)

**If issues:**
- Check if @ovo360 Instagram account exists
- Try opening link directly in browser
- Check if Instagram is blocked in your region
